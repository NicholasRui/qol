## Todo


Make some code for prop diagrams with different x axis options

have a file with all of mesa’s constants in it

Makes magnetic quantities and does some integrals better

Subclass of ax that can easily make them fancy and make log spaced ticks that are good

Make hr diagram easily




for mesatoolkit package:
- class object-oriented framework where i can attach each step
- it will automatically handle how the rn file is supposed to look
- one possible step can be evolving this stupid shit to annihilate a certain element
- automatically names things, but can be overridden
- make shell-burning object


- In Python package, artificially modify certain elements
make a custom mesa network that removes all hydrogen >:)
also shell-burning
generate schematic of which inlists feed into what



plot code: easily make text at one of the corners

set directory for saving plots at top of doc and never touch it again

add easy capability for ticking by 2, 5, 10, or 1, 3, 10, etc.

add to mesatoolkit ability to change surface composition easily

add ability to write text parallel to plot


## automate animations?





## automated workflow
make some "canonical" slides to mix and match
test points and stuff for figure development in package

In package, automatically plot magnetic white dwarfs B&L style

package should be able to import both histories and profile at the same time
